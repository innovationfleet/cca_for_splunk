# This playbook covers rolling upgrade of index cluster C1 and search head cluster C1.
# If there is a need to upgrade more clusters, copy this file to your infrastructure
# playbooks directory and add more clusters to it.
#
# REPO_TYPE=infrastructure
# MENU_DESC=Upgrade Splunk on all cluster dependent servers.
# EXTRA_VARS=cca_splunk_enterprise_upgrade(false) \
# shcluster_precheck(true) upgrade_check(true) \
# shc_upgrade_method(rolling|[offline]) \
# shc_upgrade_kvstore_engine(false)

# Index Cluster upgrade
# https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DistSearch/UpgradeaSHC
# Disable deferred scheduled searches - Should be possible to configure on the Search heads prior to the upgrade
