# This playbook covers rolling upgrade of index cluster C1 and search head cluster C1.
# If there is a need to upgrade more clusters, copy this file to your infrastructure
# playbooks directory and add more clusters to it.
#
# REPO_TYPE=infrastructure
# MENU_DESC=Upgrade Splunk on all cluster dependent servers.
# EXTRA_VARS=cca_splunk_enterprise_upgrade(false) \
# shcluster_precheck(true) upgrade_check(true) \
# shc_upgrade_method(rolling|[offline]) \
# shc_upgrade_kvstore_engine(false)

# Use shc_upgrade_kvstore_engine to upgrade the kvstore engine to wiredtiger
# valid for enterprise version 9.0 to 9.3. In 9.4 the kvstore enginge
