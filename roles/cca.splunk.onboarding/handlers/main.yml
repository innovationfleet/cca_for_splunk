# tasks file for cca.splunk.onboarding
#
# Description:
#   The handlers listen to events from tasks and has different implementation
#   depending on type of Splunk instance that issue a notify action.
#   When splund restarts are notified on Indexer peers, the handler needs
#   to resolve information of the correct Cluster Manager to inform.
#   This is done by mapping a clustered cluster peer to the hostgroup of its
#   manager.
#
#   For splunkd restarts the state file is stored in /tmp, if the host restarts
#   the /tmp directory will be cleared. No problem as the service will also be
#   restarted.
#
#   If the handler should inform that a push is needed then the state file needs
#   to be stored persistently on the filesystem, this is done by storing the file
#   in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/
#
# Prerequisite:
#   Index cluster groups needs to be named according to cluster_c1 - cluster_c9
