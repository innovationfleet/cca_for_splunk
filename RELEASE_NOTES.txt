    CCA for Splunk's user interface is a helper function that assists in creating and execute the
    ansible-playbook commands for a give playbook and host selection. It gives full control
    to see and select target hosts. Each ansible playbook has a set of configurable arguments,
    on the page with extra vars, additional variables are listed with their default values.

    You will be guided through playbook selection, host limits and options to configure the
    additional variables.

    Release notes:

    2025.3.1.2
              - Enhanced deployment server reload state file cleanup during Splunk restarts and server reboots.
                Ensures both restart and reload state files are properly cleaned up on deployment servers.
              - Updated deprecated ansible environment variable ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=yaml. Use these variables
                instead, set them in your ~/.profile_local file on your manager server.
                    export ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=ansible.builtin.default
                    export ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_RESULT_FORMAT=yaml
                    export ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_FORMAT_PRETTY=true

              Bug fixes:
                * Corrected an issue with onboarding groups that use the dest_dir option. Incorrect variable used
                  in directory references.
                * Include jq in the list of cca_baseline_software, defined in group_vars/all/linux. Copy settings from
                  the infrastructure group_vars/all/linux template file.
                * Improved robustness of rsync status classification filters to handle empty lists and invalid input.
                * Fixed certificate validation error handling with proper default values for undefined variables.
                * Corrected onboarding task variable references and improved ansible-lint compliance across multiple files.


    2025.3.1.1
              - Added configurable temporary directory option for rsync operations during app staging.
                Set cca_local_tmp_dir to override default /tmp/cca_tmp directory location, update
                your local settings from the updated file in templates directory
                onboarding_templates/environment/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/all/onboarding


    2025.3.1
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.4.4, Splunk 9.4.x track is recommended for production usage.
              - Improved index cluster preflight status when running deploy_manager_apps.yml playbook, fail fast
                if preflight status is not ok. Set 'skip_deployment_preflight_check' to true to override preflight
                checks in the beginning.
              - Improved kvstore upgrade logic, kvstore upgrade starts after the last Search Head Cluster Member
                is upgraded. Kvstore upgrades only run for upgrades from version 9.3.
              - Improved speed during upgrade, if pigz tool is available the new 10.0 package extraction saves
                up to 90 seconds per host. Install pigz with your package manager or configure_linux.yml playbook.
                Update group_vars/all/linux and add pigz in the cca_baseline_software list.
              - Improved speed of temp file cleanup in manager temp directory.
              - Updated the upgrade playbook upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers to start with Cluster Managers,
                especially important when there are standalone searchheads in the infrastructure. Option to skip
                CM upgrade with extra vars, by setting upgrade_cca_manager to false if there are no standalone
                searchheads.
              - Replaced rolling_upgrade_splunk_clusters.yml with rolling_upgrade_splunk_clusters_multi_shc.yml
                to add support for multiple search head clusters as the default option.
              - Improved validation logic for mandatory settings, prior to 9.4.x upgrade. Strict x509 validation now
                checks that the required variables are set in server.conf. Required settings come from
                group_vars/all/general_settings, ensure you have at least the
                cca_infrastructure_general_settings_file_version: '2025.3.1' version in the file and the settings
                are applied on all hosts prior to a 9.4.+ upgrade, apply using the managed_* playbooks.
              - To be fully compliant with Splunk Enterprise v10.0, set block_splunk_search_over_http_get_request_v1_api
                to true and test your integrations. Switch back if there are any issues. There is a v2 version of the
                REST API that should be used.
              - Improved kvstore upgrade detection and handling, especially on Search Head Members.
              - Applied configuration settings to harden Splunk Inputs sslVersions.
              - Using latest templates for CCA, the managed infrastructure will pass all infrastructure related health checks
                required as preparation for Splunk 10.0+ upgrade, setting block_splunk_search_over_http_get_request_v1_api to true.
              - Splunk appsCA.pem must be part of the sslRootCAPath cert for Splunk App Management to work, this is mow ensured
                in all manage playbooks, by appending the appsCA.pem to the Root CA cert.
              - Added certificate validity period check (default: 30 days, configurable via cca_splunk_cert_min_validity_days)

              Role: cca.core.linux:
                - Simplified and enhanced Transparent Huge Pages (THP) configuration across different Linux distributions:
                  * Reliable systemd service approach replacing complex multi-method fallbacks
                  * Created disable-thp.service that runs early at boot (after sysinit.target)
                  * Immediate THP disabling without requiring system reboot
                  * Direct THP control via /sys filesystem for universal compatibility
                  * Enhanced error handling with final verification and clear failure messages
                  * Simplified maintenance while improving reliability across all systemd-based distributions
                  * Improved task reliability and debugging capabilities for THP configuration

                - Enhanced APT package update handling and exclusion logic:
                  * Replaced dpkg_selections with package existence checking using apt-cache
                  * Dynamic package exclusion based on cca_control.package.updates.exclude_packages variable
                  * Improved apt update method using apt-get dist-upgrade simulation with dynamic exclude options
                  * Enhanced parsing of apt upgrade simulation output for better package detection
                  * Added proper cleanup step to unhold packages after checks
                  * Prevents errors when exclude packages don't exist in the dpkg database
                  * Better error handling and conditional logic for determining when updates are needed

              Bug fixes:
                * Corrected logic to handle strict x509 certificate validation. Mandatory for Splunk Enterprise
                  version 9.4+. Validation added during upgrade pre-check to version 9.4+. Verify your certificates
                  using the extra-vars, strict_x509_cert_validation_test set to true. Run any manage playbook to
                  run the validation.
                * Fix task install_chrony.yml to use shell instead of command module when using executable
                  argument.
                * Fixed validation check for strict x509 results.
                * Fixed cgroup issue when the running kernel and supported kernel version uses cgroupv2 but Splunk
                  is on a version that only supports cgroupv1.
                * Fix issue when kvstore upgrade was incorrectly seen as completed on stepping stone upgrade
                  version.
                * Fixed error in when condition, Splunkd service was always restarted when running
                  configure_linux_servers.yml playbook.
                * Always finalize the upgrade in cluster manager, handle case where it has already been
                  completed.

              Beta:
                * Support for Splunk Enterprise 10.0.0, not ready for production usage.


    2025.2.2
              - ⚠️ REQUIRED ANSIBLE UPDATE ⚠️
                Ansible 2.18.6+ is required to run CCA from this release and onwards.
                Run ./cca_ctrl --upgrade from your CCA main repository and select the playbook
                'upgrade_cca_manager.yml'. When the upgrade is complete, log out and log in again.
                Your shell prompt (PS1) should now indicate that 'ansible2.18' is the active virtual environment.
              - Important:
                 * Copy settings from the infrastructure group_vars/all/general_settings template directory.
                   An option to disable a non-documented prometheus setting that is know to cause memory leak
                   issues on especially forwarders. CCA will disable on all hosts.
                 * This version of CCA deprecates OS versions incompatible with Ansible 2.17+. To proceed
                   with deprecated OS versions, set `"cca_accept_deprecated_os": true` when running the
                   configure_linux_servers playbook.
                 * CCA has solved the breaking changes in Ansible, by using shell fallback for deprecated OS
                   versions.
                 * Support for Enterprise Linux version 7 and Amazon Linux 2 has been removed.
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.4.3, Splunk 9.4.x track is recommended for production usage.
              - Added Ubuntu 24.04 support.
                * Important: Update your infrastructure group_vars/all/linux file using the
                  reference from templates/infrastructure_template/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/all/linux.
                  It has added handling for OS package differences between dnf and apt package managers.
              - Enhanced stability with ansible retry on all relevant Splunk commands. High load scenarios
                will be gracefully retried and fail only after a configurable retry with proper default
                values.
              - Introduced rescue for Index Cluster pre-flight check, after the timeout, Splunkd is restarted
                and pre-flight is checked again.
              - Added command timeout for all command tasks.
              - Added command timeout and pipefail to all shell tasks.
              - Updated logic to control when to upgrade Splunk, moved functionality from playbook to tasks.
              - Improved cgroups handling for kernels that support cgroups v2 but Splunk Enterprise
                is less than 9.4.
              - Playbook merge and updated with optional variables for onboarding directory references.
              - Complete overhaul, handled all ansible-lint issues in tasks and playbooks. Changed shell to
                command module where it's not required. Added /bin/bash as executable for shell module that
                is required on ubuntu servers.
              - Added a more robust cleanup of temp files on the CCA Manager server.


              Bug fixes:
                * Removed vars cca_splunk_enterprise_upgrade: true from rolling upgrade
                  playbook as it overruled the default "false" and always triggered an upgrade.
                * Fixed cgroups and Splunk version logic that prevented Systemd to be correctly configured on
                  legacy hosts and Splunk Enterprise 9.4.
                * Changed strict x509 certificate validation assessment to only run when
                  splunk_enterprise_version is set to 9.4.0+.
                * cca.core.linux: Fix reboot handler in selinux reconfiguration scenario.

    2025.1.1.1
              Bug fixes:
                * Corrected destination path for app deployment after migration to ansible synchronize module.

    2025.1.1
              - Important:
                 * This version of CCA deprecates OS versions incompatible with Ansible 2.17+. To proceed
                   with deprecated OS versions, set `"cca_accept_deprecated_os": true` when running the
                   configure_linux_servers playbook.
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.3.3, Splunk 9.3.x track is recommended for production usage.
              - Introduced template support for web security headers. Copy settings from the infrastructure
                group_vars/all/general_settings templates applicable to all non-search head members. For
                search head members, use group_vars/searchhead_deployer_shcluster_cX. Review the settings
                and enable by setting `enable_web_security_headers=true` or
                `enable_web_security_headers_searchhead_members=true` in the appropriate inventory group.
              - Updated CCA to support Splunk versions 9.1.8, 9.2.5, 9.3.3, 9.4.0, and 9.4.1. These versions
                address the high CVE: https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2025-0301
              - Updated support for the new `.tgz` file naming format for Splunk Enterprise installation files.
              - Updated Splunk Enterprise download validation to use SHA512 checksums.

              - Important 9.4 Upgrade Information:
                 * Ensure you meet the required prerequisites for the KVStore upgrade in Splunk 9.4+.
                   Verify that your cca_splunk_extension_cert_rootca includes your Root CA and all
                   Intermediate CAs, and is deployed before upgrading to Splunk Enterprise 9.4.
                 * The setting `sslRootCAPath` has been added to the certificate configuration in
                   server.conf. Update your infrastructure group_vars/all/general_settings using the
                   reference from templates/infrastructure_template/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/all/general_settings.
                 * Use the manage_* playbooks in check_mode to validate your certificates. Alternatively,
                   copy the cert-inspect.sh script from templates/infrastructure_template/splunk/etc/auth/certs
                   to your infrastructure directory and validate your certificates before deployment.
              - Full support for cgroups version 2. The upgrade is performed automatically when running
                the configure_linux_servers.yml playbooks after upgrading to Splunk 9.4+.
              - Added automatic handling of KVStore upgrades introduced in 9.4. The playbook will now
                wait until the KVStore upgrade is completed. This process takes time as kvstore is upgraded
                by splunk 3 times in the background. Do not set shc_upgrade_kvstore_engine to true for 9.4
                upgrades.
              - Added KVStore version check before upgrading to Splunk Enterprise 9.4+. This corrects a
                bug in Splunk when a initial version was installed with engine version 4.2.
              - Added strict X.509 certificate validation as part of the upgrade pre-check to avoid
                post-upgrade issues.
              - Added new internal deployment server indexes to cluster_manager_cluster_cX. Replace your
                existing infrastructure group_vars/cluster_manager_cluster_c1 with the version from
                templates/infrastructure_template/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/cluster_manager_cluster_c1.
              - Improved the stability of the Splunk `offline` command on index peers. If a timeout occurs,
                the system now performs a `splunk stop` as fallback.
              - Improved Splunk Version handling during server reboot and cgroups configuration updates.

              Bug Fixes:
                - Corrected splunk_conf_host_settings that was incorrectly referring splunk_conf_group_settings.
                - Corrected syntax reference of file stat results in conditionals.
                - Corrected incorrect case on state variables.

                   splunk_ingest_actions app that was introduced in Splunk Enterprise 9.3
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.2.4, Splunk 9.2.x track is recommended for production usage.
              - Syntax update in playbooks and tasks to fix deprecation warnings in future
                ansible versions.
              - Changed all become_user conditions to use "{{ splunk_user }}"
              - CCA Supports co-locating the CCA manager on a Splunk Server. For playbooks that
                issue a Server reboot, it will be suppressed if a manager is co-located. For that
                server, a reboot must be dealt with manually.
              - Updated diff files for post upgrade cleanup.
              - Updated .gitignore with new Splunks internal files.

              Bug Fixes:
                - Corrected condition in sever_reboot_handler to allow full control over

    2024.2.2.3 (Hot fixes for Premium Customers Only)

    2024.1.2
              - Important notice - Breaking change:

                * In previous versions, the CCA infrastructure repository was identified using the shorthand 'infra'.
                  As our needs have evolved, this naming convention no longer scales effectively. Starting with this
                  release, we have renamed all shorthand references of 'infra' to 'infrastructure' to more accurately
                  reflect its purpose. This change affects both the repository identifier and variable names within
                  the system.

                * Important for End Users:
                  If you have a local copy of the infrastructure repository that was created before version 2024.1.2,
                  you will need to update your repository settings. This ensures compatibility with the new naming
                  conventions. Additionally, an issue with the incorrect repository name labeled 'CcaRepo' has been
                  been corrected in this release. Some variables has changed from strict validation identified with
                  UPDATE_* to use OPTIONAL_* instead, corrected for some non-critical variables in this release.
                  Please make sure your settings are updated to align with the changes described below:

              - Setup wizard has been updated to be much faster while copying template files.
              - Handling of splunk_conf_[general|group|host]_settings has been simplified and custom filter_plugins has
                been developed to further strengthen the validation in the cca.core.splunk role.
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.1.4, Splunk 9.1.x track is still recommended for production usage.
              - Updated the cca.splunk.onboarding role to accommodate scenarios where a deployment server coexists with
                other Splunk roles. To deploy deployment-apps to a server not listed in the [deployment_servers] inventory
                group. Configure the additional option dest_dir: 'deployment-apps' in group_vars for your Ansible group.
                Use the standard playbook deploy_apps.yml for this scenario.

              Bug fixes:
              - Fixed issue that initialize task would not run if inventory group was missing.

    2024.1.1
              - Important:
                  * If you are running on Linux Kernel 5.8 or later, execute the 'configure_linux_server.yml'
                    playbook on all Splunk servers to install and configure the included
                    'cca_cgroup_version_daemon'. This is a systemd service that takes care of re-enabling
                    support for cgroup v1. In the event that the Kernel is updated to a version requiring
                    the switch to cgroup v2, 'the Splunkd.service' may fail to start after a reboot.
                  * For the initial installation of Splunk using CCA, there are no additional steps to
                    be performed.
              - Bumped Splunk Enterprise version to 9.1.3, Splunk 9.1 track is recommended for production
                usage.
              - Added script to ease download of supported Splunk Enterprise versions.
                ${CCA_REPO_DIR}/roles/cca.splunk.enterprise-install/files/bin/download_splunk_enterprise.sh
                Tgz files are downloaded and stored in ${CCA_INFRASTRUCTURE_DIR}/splunk/var/images/
              - Updated conditions that rely on ansible groups so inventory can be made smaller and
                unused groups can be removed from the inventory.
              - Improved handling of cluster bundle validation errors. Fail task only on critical
                errors.
              - Changed static retries for splunk commands. They are all having default values and
                are configurable with custom tuning values on global, group or host level.
                List of configurable variables:
                  * cca_splunk_bootstrap_shcluster_captain_retries
                  * cca_splunk_cluster_bundle_status_retries
                  * cca_splunk_finalize_upgrade_retries
                  * cca_splunk_kvstore_backup_status_retries
                  * cca_splunk_kvstore_status_retries
                  * cca_splunk_login_retries
                  * cca_splunkd_restart_retries
                  * cca_splunkd_start_retries
                  * cca_splunkd_status_retries
              - Improved logic to store staging apps during deployment, related to data onboarding.
              - Improved detection filter in rsync to avoid false positives during deployment-apps
                deployment.
              - Refactoring cca.splunk.ssl-certificates tasks to better detect certificate update
                needs.
              - Updated prerequisites running CCA on Manager server
                  * Updated python version to 3.11.3+, install a new venv, update .profile_local

                    all included modules.
                  * Removed support for Amazon Linux 2 for CCA Manager due to ansible and python
                    dependency incompatibility.
              - Python Packages installed by the setup wizard, verify that older installations has
                them installed.

                etc/system/local/inputs.conf
              - Updated the rolling update playbook to handle Linux kernels with no standard
                cgroupv1 support, including latest kernel updates for Fedora and RHEL 9.
              - Added a cca_cgroup_version_daemon to make sure cgroupv1 is available even if host
                has been updated manually without CCA. Run configure_linux_server playbook to
                create and enable it.

              Bug fixes:
                * Corrected splunkd restart and reload deploy-server handler that caused both
                  a splunkd restart and reload deploy-server during the same change.

                *  Directories in onboarding repo for splunk/etc/manager-apps,
                    splunk/etc/deployment-apps and splunk/etc/shcluster/apps are no longer used in
                    standard data onboarding and can safely be removed if available in a onboarding
                    repo.
              - Added requirement to have community.crypto module install. Install via
                ansible-galaxy collection install community.crypto

                  handle lab environments with lower specs.
                * General correction of spelling errors.

    2022.2.3 Set current Splunk Enterprise version so that group_vars files can use it.
             Updated deployment_server group_vars file, if current Splunk Enterprise

             To upgrade just the Splunk Deployment Servers, add an explicit version in the
             hosts inventory file.
             [deployment_servers:vars]
             splunk_enterprise_version='9.0.0'

             Store the tgz file in the infrastructure repo at splunk/var/images.

             Run ./cca_ctrl and select the playbook upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml
             and target only the Deployment Servers. Perform the upgrade in a test environment
             before doing so in Production.
