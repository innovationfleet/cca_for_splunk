# Automation Readiness

Automation Readiness is a playbook developed by us to help you determine how prepared your environment is to run CCA for Splunk. The playbook checks for a list of CCA for Splunk prerequisites, such as:

* OS version
* Ansible version
* Python version
* Ansible environment variables
* CCA for Splunk variables

**Automation Readiness Score**

The playbook outputs a score, referred as Automation Readiness Score.

The Automation Readiness Score tells you how well your environment is prepared to run CCA for Splunk from 0 (not at all) to 3100 (fully!). At least a score of 2300 is required to run CCA for Splunk. The Automation Readiness Playbook will also tell you which steps that are required to increase your Automation Readiness Score based on our recommended best practices.

If you have run the playbook `setup_cca_manager.yml` you should reach a readiness score of 2300 without any extra steps and be ready to continue with the setup wizard.

Once you reach Automation Readiness Score of 2300 you should be ready to execute `./cca_ctrl --setup` from the main *cca_for_splunk* repo. See [Setup Wizard](#setup-wizard)

After that the setup wizard is completed, you can re-run the automation readiness playbook. If you now
get at least 2900 in Automation Readiness Score you are able to run CCA for Splunk.

We have also described installation steps according to our best practices, following these steps will increase your Automation Readiness Score.
 * [Python installation](#python-39-installation)
 * [Virtual env and Ansible Installation](#create-python-virtual-env-and-install-ansible-with-collections)

## Optional: CCA Manager Setup (Recommended)

Our recommendation is to have a designated central server that has access to your Splunk infrastructure servers & that this central server has a technical user that you can access via `sudo` command.

Operating System (OS)'s are fully supported to run the CCA Manager. Note that target OS's for Splunk can differ over time. See explicit documentation for OS support for Splunk using CCA for Splunk.

* RedHat 8-9
* CentOS 8-9 Stream
* Rocky Linux 8-9
* Amazon Linux 2023
* Ubuntu 20

### Hardware requirements
Minimum hardware requirements:
* CPU: 2 CPU
* RAM: 4GB RAM (Onboarding repository size depends on the apps you have stored in it)
* Disk: 40 GB (100 GB In enterprise environments with many apps)

Feel free to try and run these playbooks elsewhere but on your own responsibility.

### Software requirements
Necessary packages installed on operating system
* rsync
* git
* openssl

### Splunk Enterprise version
When it comes to determining which Splunk Enterprise version to use, our recommendation would be avoid latest versions for production environment. The latest version can be unknown to many and contain several bugs. Using CCA for Splunk to try out latest versions in development environments is recommended.

For production environment(s) we recommend to use a stable version, usually the latest minor version of the latest major version is proven to be stable. Except for when a new major release, then the CCA compatibility and production stability will be assessed before that release is recommended to use in CCA.

CCA for Splunk's supported versions:
* Splunk Enterprise 8.X and 9.X

### SSH Keys
A remote user that has SSH key based login enabled and has `sudo ALL NO PASSWD` configured is also required on the Splunk Infrastructure servers that CCA for Splunk will manage.

## Step 1: Clone cca_for_splunk repository

Logon to the server you have designated as CCA for Splunk Manager. First we will create directories where the cloned `cca_for_splunk`repository will reside. See example of commands below.

```
mkdir ~/data/main ~/data/secrets ~/clones
cd ~/clones
git clone https://github.com/innovationfleet/cca_for_splunk.git
cd cca_for_splunk
```

## Step 2: Execute Automation Readiness Playbook
We will now execute the Automation Readiness Playbook with `ansible-playbook`command. The playbook will perform tests and assert that your server & account is setup as it should. For every successful assertion, points will be added to your Automation Readiness Score. In the end you will be presented with your final score.
In order to perform the execution of this playbook, you need to perform the steps below to "create Python virtual env and Install Ansible with collections"

```
cd ~/clones/cca_for_splunk

ansible-playbook -i localhost, playbooks/automation_readiness_cca_manager.yml -v
```

# Correct Automation Readiness issues

Here we list the different checks that are performed by the Automation Readiness Playbook and what should be configured to correct them if they didn't pass in your playbook execution.

## Python 3.11 Installation
As a user with `sudo` privileges execute

```
sudo yum install python39
```

## Create Python virtual env and Install Ansible with collections
Logon as the same user that executed the Automation Readiness Playbook. Execute the following commands to setup Python virtual environment variables & install Ansible

```
cd
alias python='/usr/bin/python3.11'
mkdir -p ~/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18
cd ~/tools/python-venv
python -m venv ansible2.18
source ansible2.18/bin/activate
~/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ansible-core==2.18.6
pip install ansible-runner pcrypt cryptography jmespath Jinja2 requests urllib3
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
ansible-galaxy collection install community.crypto

```
Add the following line to your user profile to activate the Python virtual environment every time you login.

```
source ~/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/bin/activate
```
Perform a test by logging out & in again and execute the following command.
```
if [[ -v VIRTUAL_ENV ]] ; then ansible --version ; else echo "VIRTUAL_ENV is not configured" ;  fi
 ```

You should expect a similar output as below. If you are not getting the expected result, review the previous steps.
```
ansible [core 2.18.6]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/opt/cca_manager/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /opt/cca_manager/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /opt/cca_manager/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /opt/cca_manager/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.11.6 (main, Nov 22 2023, 00:00:00) [GCC 11.4.1 20230605 (Red Hat 11.4.1-2)] (/opt/cca_manager/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/bin/python3.11)
  jinja version = 3.1.2
  libyaml = True
  ```

## Required Environment variables

Experience have proven that we have much more control and less errors using environment variables instead of a managed ansible.cfg. This readiness playbook will check that all necessary and some optional environment variables are configured. Add missing environment variables to your user profile. When completed, source the user profile and execute `env` to validate that they are set correctly.

### ANSIBLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE

Ansible needs a reference to the private ssh key file that shall be used to access Splunk infrastructure servers. Add `export ANSIBLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=path_to_private_key_file` to your user profile and source it when you are done and before next automation readiness run.

### ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH

Ansible needs how to find roles, this is required for `cca_for_splunk` where the playbooks are called from outside the repository. Verify that the directory below match your setup. Add
`export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=./roles:~/clones/cca_for_splunk/roles` to your user profile and source it when you are done and before next automation readiness run.

### ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE

Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to output a random string that you then add to your `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` file. See proposed file name below.

Add `export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/data/secrets/cca_ansible_vault_secret` to your user profile and source it when you are done and before next automation readiness run.


## Recommended Environment variables

### ANSIBLE_STRATEGY

The default strategy in Ansible is called linear and doesn't need to be specified separately. In `cca_for_splunk` the opposite is true, here we specify which playbooks that needs to run the linear strategy, for the rest we can control it with the environment variable `ANSIBLE_STRATEGY`.

If we set it to `mitogen_linear` the playbooks will run much faster, up 4X.

To use it your self, read up on [Ansible Mitogen](https://github.com/mitogen-hq/mitogen).
Temporarily we have forked and patched the mitogen package. Get latest from https://github.com/innovationfleet/mitogen Remember to checkout branch ansible.2.18.6 after cloning the repo. Currently the package from github is needed, download and install it in the directory referenced by [ANSIBLE_STRATEGY_PLUGINS](#"ansiblestrategyplugins"-"internalccaforsplunktoolsmitogen-masteransiblemitogenpluginsstrategy")

Add `export ANSIBLE_STRATEGY="mitogen_linear"`
to start using the highly recommended strategy plugin.

### ANSIBLE_STRATEGY_PLUGINS

Add `export ANSIBLE_STRATEGY_PLUGINS=~/tools/mitogen/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy` and set it to the directory where you have installed the mitogen package.

## Optional Environment variables

### ANSIBLE_CALLBACKS_ENABLED

Get useful summary information at the end of each task as well time spend per executed task. Add
`export ANSIBLE_CALLBACKS_ENABLED="ansible.posix.profile_tasks"` to your user profile and source it when you are done and before next automation readiness run.

### ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK

Increased readability of Ansible terminal output, yaml formatted. Add
`export ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK="yaml"` to your user profile and source it when you are done and before next automation readiness run.


## Summary of configured variables in your user profile

```
export ANSIBLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=~/data/secrets/cca_ansible_id_rsa
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=./roles:~/clones/cca_for_splunk/roles
export ANSIBLE_STRATEGY_PLUGINS=~/tools/mitogen/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
export ANSIBLE_STRATEGY="mitogen_linear"
export ANSIBLE_CALLBACKS_ENABLED="ansible.posix.profile_tasks"
export ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK="yaml"
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/data/secrets/cca_ansible_vault_secret
export ANSIBLE_INTERPRETER_PYTHON=auto_silent
export CCA_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPO_DIR=~/data/main/cca_splunk_infrastructure
export CCA_ONBOARDING_REPO_DIR=~/data/main/cca_splunk_onboarding
export CCA_REPO_DIR=~/data/main/cca_for_splunk

source ~/tools/python-venv/ansible2.18/bin/activate
```
Wait with ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE until it exists.

### Splunk Enterprise Package

`cca_for_splunk` uses Splunk Enterprise tgz files for installing Splunk on target Splunk servers. The setup wizard will store the Splunk Enterprise version in the infrastructure repo at splunk/var/images. Store the initial Splunk Enterprise Linux tar file in `/var/tmp/splunk_tmp/` and the wizard take care of the rest.

# Setup Wizard
When you have reached a automation readiness score of 2300 then you are ready to run the setup wizard. Read up on what the setup_wizard playbook does [here](/README.md) and **step 2b.**

In short it configures the two companion directories where custom settings and apps are stored. In the playbook you will be asked to set names of the companion directories, the environment, the general pass4SymmKey and admin password.

If you have an existing environment that your are transforming, you have to update the pass4SymmKeys for the different cluster and shcluster id's.

## Inventory file
When the wizard is completed, CCA for Splunk needs a few hosts to configure. All hosts are configured in the inventory file, the file is found in the companion directory `environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/hosts`

At first the hosts file can seem complicated, be assured, it's not. All Splunk's Validated Architecture components are listed in the file. It also have 3 availability groups pre-configured. Find your group name, locate it in the hosts file. Add your host to one of the pre-configured availability groups.

## Environment Specific Variables

Look for all variables that needs to be updates. `grep -R UPDATE environments` will list all of them if you are in the root of the companion directories.
