# CCA ansible hosts inventory file
#
# Coming up with a Splunk server naming convention that works for small
# and large installations as well as its uniquely identifies a Splunk
# role is harder than you first envision.
#
# The structure of Ansible groups and children groups in this hosts
# file has been carefully planned and tested. It look massive at first
# sight but the usage if it is hassle free. Just identify by looking at
# the Splunk Validated Architecture what role you like to configure and
# add your host to it. If your target architecture is C keep the base
# configuration in group_vars for cluster_manager_cluster_c* and
# cluster_peers_cluster_c* then you will get a multi site cluster
# with just one site. Which is far better for the future than a single
# site index cluster.
#
#
# Groups available in this inventory is here for a purpose, the groups
# are linked to logic in the cca_for_splunk playbooks. Unused groups
# must be kept in the file, they do no harm staying in the file but
# if they are removed, task logic might be impacted.
#
# The structure of this hosts file is using the ini file format and is
# intentionally selected as there is many nested groups and variables
# in this file. As mentioned The existing groups are important to keep,
# if other groups are needed, add them as a child group to one of the
# existing ones to keep integrity of the CCA roles. The hosts file with
# hosts are safe to duplicate between the infrastructure and data
# onboarding repo.
#
# Server names is up to decision for every organization or user of this
# automation framework to decide upon. For those that would like to
# have inspiration for a naming convention of servers, we provide a
# suggestion, that makes it easy to identify server role, cluster and
# site relations and availability group, just by looking at the name
# of an server.
#
# Every splunk role as seen in the splunk_servers list below has a
# unique 3 letter code. Search Head and Index clusters has a 4 digit
# code where the first digit represents the cluster ID 1-9
# The second digit is the availability group id, 1-9. In this hosts
# file availability group 1-3 has been pre-configured.
# The two last digits is consecutive number from 01-99 to uniquely
# identify a server.
# Non clustered servers has a 3 digit code, where the first digit
# identifies the availability group 1-9 and the last two is the
# consecutive server number 01-99
#
# For each of the roles the corresponding name of the Splunk Validated
# Architecture (VA) is listed.
#
# Clustered Servers
# Code  Splunk Role                  Example with 2 ag's   VA's

[upgrade_shclusters_offline:children]


# Here follows host groups that facilities grouping of hosts into
# availability groups.
#
# Availability groups is a way to control high availability
# requirements when managing or upgrading Splunk servers.
# As an example, you have 2 forwarders configured for collecting HEC
# data. They sit behind a load balancer and you would like to manage
# them one by one to avoid unnecessary service unavailability. Then
# place the hosts in separate availability groups.
#
# Index and search head clusters *_c1-c3 are configured with an
# availability group respectively, (ag1-ag3). If your environment
# has more than 3 different index and search head clusters.
# Then expand this hosts file with the required configuration.
#
# If you have a need to manage more than 3 separate availability
# groups,like having a setup of a index or search head cluster with
# more than 3 sites. Then modify this hosts file accordingly and make
# a local copy of all playbooks that needs to be updated to handle
# additional availability groups. If availability groups are not
# relevant for your use case, place all your hosts in the first
# availability group, ag1. This way all control logic will work
# as designed.
#
# Availability groups are used in playbooks to respect high
# availability configuration requirements by performing actions on
# only one availability group at the time.
